MyToken Smart Contract
Project Title
MyToken: A Simple Ethereum-Based Token Contract

Description
MyToken is an ERC20-like smart contract implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows users to mint and burn tokens, keeping track of each address's balance. The primary purpose of this contract is to demonstrate a basic token mechanism where tokens can be created (minted) and destroyed (burned), with appropriate checks to ensure balance integrity.

Getting Started
Installing
To interact with this contract, you need to have the following:

An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask
A connection to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby, or Ganache for local testing)
A development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat
Executing Program
To deploy and interact with the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (if applicable):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MyToken.git
cd MyToken
Open the Contract in Remix:

Go to Remix.
Create a new file and paste the contract code into the editor.
Compile the Contract:

Select the appropriate compiler version (0.8.18) in Remix.
Compile the MyToken.sol file.
Deploy the Contract:

In the Remix sidebar, navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3 for MetaMask).
Click "Deploy".
Interact with the Contract:

Use the deployed contract interface in Remix to call mint and burn functions.
For minting tokens:
solidity
Copy code
mint(<address>, <value>);
For burning tokens:
solidity
Copy code
burn(<address>, <value>);
Help
For common issues or questions:

Contract Deployment: Ensure your wallet is connected and has sufficient ETH for gas fees.
Function Execution: Make sure the address and values used in mint and burn are valid and the address has enough balance to burn tokens.
If you encounter any issues, refer to the Solidity documentation or seek help from the Ethereum developer community.
